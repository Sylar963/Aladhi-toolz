### Introduction

I am **Aladhi**, a quantitative researcher and developer focused on identifying and capitalizing on market inefficiencies through systematic, model-driven strategies. This repository contains the body of my independent research, strategy implementations, and analytical tooling.

My approach is grounded in statistical analysis, rigorous backtesting, and disciplined risk management. I apply these principles to both freelance consulting projects on **Upwork** and my own proprietary trading research.

### Core Areas of Focus

My work is centered around the full lifecycle of a quantitative strategy, from idea to execution.

#### 1. Signal Generation & Alpha Research
Developing novel alpha signals from price, volume, and alternative data. This involves rigorous statistical testing and feature engineering to find predictive patterns.

</p>

#### 2. Strategy Backtesting & Validation
Constructing robust trading models and validating their historical performance with high-quality data. I focus heavily on out-of-sample testing and avoiding overfitting.

#### 3. Execution & Automation
Building low-latency connections to crypto and equity exchanges for automated, real-time order execution. Reliability and precision are paramount.
